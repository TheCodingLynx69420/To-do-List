# To-do-List

<h2>Introduction: </h2>

<p>Just a simple to do list but made more aesthetic and useful, which anyone can use in their daily life</p>
<p>I also used The Local storage method in Javascript to save the Todo Progress so if you wanna shutdown/close the tab feel free to do so, because your progress would be save!</p>

<h3>All the codes are explained using comments in the code files, but if anyone have any question be sure to ask me!</h3>
